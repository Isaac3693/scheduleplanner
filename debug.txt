Error 1: segmentation fault
    Did not check if check_arg_format returned NULL, read indices from a NULL pointer
Error 2: logical error
    Seems that word_in_string() isn't doing what it was originally intended to do... No, just didn't look right...
Error 3: Another SIGSEGV
    Unable to make timeslot (REASON: Date string is added in the timeslot) //forget to fgets after parsing the date string
    Incorrect logical flow of the program. Didn't take account of the dash in the string...
Error 4: date's month integer isn't represented correctly. Now it's the year...
    ...I assumed that the string had 3 slashes...
Error 5: Figured out the flow issue, but it couldn't append another timeslot? Perhaps the index? 
    issue: what the fuck was I on when I wrote this?
    "else if (min_end - min_start == 0) {printf("Unable to make timeslot, no time interval in between\n"); return NULL;}"
Error 6: Why does the final "::END::" string have no other semicolon (::END:)
    Solution: put a whitespace character on the end "::END:: "
    //Holy shit it works now
Error 7: It is not ordering the list now... 
    fuck... oh, I just misused an inequality...
Error 8: works fine on gdb, fucks up on normal runtime
    issue: word_in_string doesn't work as intended... Fixed it (don't use word_in_string lmao)

//Holy shit, I have a lot of errors in the making of this application... damn...

Error 1: holy shit my head hurts from writing code on the fucking bus... I should stop right now.

December 20th notes: Debugging the program
  notes on user inputs and their implementation on the arg program:
    "q" : apparently creates a segmentation fault
    "does this work" : creates only 2 arguments with the last 2 words being tied together
    "will "this" break" : runs as normal.
    "super fucking long "ass sentence that my daddy forced" me" : also runs as normal.
    ANY ONE WORD INPUT: breaks

December 21st Notes: Started writing the user interface for the program as well as the control flow
